# [Standalone] 👆🏻 Raycast Targeting
An useful system to obtain the player's id by clicking on them.

### 🔧 Configuration
You can easily customize the marker on the player head, or remove it.
You can change:
* Change the max distance for interacting with the player
* Select Control for selecting the player
* Disabled Controls during the raycasting
* Exit Controls for leaving the raycasting

### 👁️ Plus
In addition to the players you can select the peds to obtain their entity

### Disclaimer
I didn't find many resources on the forum or on GitHub that would allow you to do this, to be honest I didn't search in depth, the idea obviously didn't come from me but I think this script could be useful to many people.
